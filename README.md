This is a simple React / Chakra UI page displaying the largest 100 cryptocurrencies with an interactive search functionality. The user can add an asset to their watchlist, and can see the individual liquidity, public interest, community, and developer scores assigned to that asset by CoinGecko.

Both the list of cryptocurrencies and the relevant scores are obtained from CoinGecko's APIs.
